# Release v3.1 — Pipe Delimiters, SourceFragment, and 18 New Parsers

**Date:** February 28, 2026
**Triggered by:** [Issue #10](https://github.com/MilkMp/CIA-World-Factbooks-Archive-1990-2025/issues/10) — feedback from [@jarofromel](https://github.com/jarofromel)

---

## What Changed and Why

A contributor identified two problems in our v3.0 parsing pipeline:

1. **Ambiguous delimiters** — Collapsing original newlines to spaces in `CountryFields.Content` made sub-field parsing unreliable. Spaces appear everywhere in text, so there was no reliable way to tell where one sub-field ended and another began.

2. **Missing provenance** — When a FieldValues row said `NumericVal = 1.05, Units = male(s)/female`, there was no way to verify what text it was parsed from, or to detect when a parser silently dropped data.

Both problems were real. We fixed both.

## v3.0 vs v3.1 — By the Numbers

| Metric | v3.0 | v3.1 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Country-year records | 9,500 | 9,536 | +36 |
| Category records | 83,599 | 83,682 | +83 |
| Data fields | 1,061,522 | 1,071,603 | +10,081 |
| Structured sub-values | 1,423,506 | 1,610,973 | +187,467 |
| Distinct sub-fields | 1,848 | 2,386 | +538 |
| Dedicated parsers | 34 | 55 | +21 |
| Database size (SQLite) | ~542 MB | ~636 MB | +94 MB |

Every delta is positive. No data was lost — only gained.

### Single Database

v3.0 shipped two separate SQLite files: `factbook.db` (core tables + FTS5 search) and `factbook_field_values.db` (core tables + FieldValues). This was confusing — people didn't know which to use or whether they needed both.

v3.2 consolidates everything into one file: **`factbook.db`** (636 MB). It contains all 8 tables (core + FieldValues + FTS5 + ISOCountryCodes). The size difference was only 78 MB, not worth the confusion of two files. Download one database, get everything.

## Change 1: Content Delimiter Migration (Space -> Pipe)

### The Problem

Original CIA data uses newlines between sub-fields:

```
total population: 80.9 years
male: 78.7 years
female: 83.1 years
```

v3.0 collapsed these to spaces during parsing:

```
total population: 80.9 years male: 78.7 years female: 83.1 years
```

This created ambiguity — "years male" could be a value continuation or a sub-field boundary. The generic parser had to use heuristic label detection (`r'(\w[\w\s]*?):\s'`) which failed on edge cases.

### The Fix

v3.2 uses pipe (`|`) as the sub-field delimiter:

```
total population: 80.9 years | male: 78.7 years | female: 83.1 years
```

Pipes never appear in CIA field values, so the boundary is always unambiguous. The generic fallback parser now simply splits on `' | '`.

### Blast Radius

Audited every downstream consumer. Impact was minimal:

```
 Component                     Impact    Reason
 ────────────────────────────── ──────── ──────────────────────────────
 Webapp (country, field pages)  None     Displays Content verbatim
 Webapp (analysis dashboards)   None     Parses with regex, not delimiters
 FTS5 search index              None     SQLite tokenizer treats | as boundary
 StarDict dictionaries          None     Shows Content verbatim
 API v2 endpoints               None     Returns Content as-is in JSON
 CSV/Excel exports              None     Exports Content column directly
 FieldValues parsers (55)       None     Use field-specific regex patterns
 Generic fallback parser        Better   Already split on ' | '
```

2015-2020 data was already pipe-delimited, so the entire stack was proven to work with pipes before we made the change.

### Files Changed

```
 File                       Change
 ────────────────────────── ──────────────────────────────────────────
 etl/build_archive.py       + html_to_pipe_text() helper function
                              Replaces <br>, </p><p>, </div><div> with |
                              Applied in parse_classic(), parse_table_format(),
                              parse_collapsiblepanel_format()

 etl/load_gutenberg_years.py  Changed 4 x ' '.join() to ' | '.join()
                              in extract_indented_fields() and
                              extract_mixed_fields()
                              (NOT extract_inline_fields — those are
                              continuation lines, not sub-fields)

 etl/reload_json_years.py   Rewrote strip_html() with pipe-aware logic
                              <br><br> and </p><p> become ' | '
                              Remaining tags become spaces
```

## Change 2: SourceFragment Column

### The Problem

v3.0 FieldValues had no provenance. You could see `NumericVal = 1.05` but not what text produced it.

### The Fix

Every FieldValues row now includes `SourceFragment` — the exact text slice matched by the parser:

```sql
SELECT SubField, NumericVal, Units, SourceFragment
FROM FieldValues fv
JOIN CountryFields cf ON fv.FieldID = cf.FieldID
JOIN Countries c ON cf.CountryID = c.CountryID
WHERE c.Name = 'United States' AND c.Year = 2025
  AND cf.FieldName = 'Sex ratio';
```

| SubField | NumericVal | Units | SourceFragment |
|----------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| at_birth | 1.05 | male(s)/female | at birth: 1.05 male(s)/female |
| 0-14_years | 1.06 | male(s)/female | 0-14 years: 1.06 male(s)/female |
| 15-24_years | 1.19 | male(s)/female | 15-24 years: 1.19 male(s)/female |
| total_population | 1.0 | male(s)/female | total population: 1 male(s)/female |

### Parse Confidence Metric

SourceFragment enables automated quality checks:

```sql
-- Flag under-parsed fields (< 50% of Content was captured)
SELECT cf.FieldID, cf.FieldName,
       LENGTH(cf.Content) AS content_len,
       SUM(LENGTH(fv.SourceFragment)) AS parsed_len,
       ROUND(100.0 * SUM(LENGTH(fv.SourceFragment)) / LENGTH(cf.Content), 1) AS pct
FROM FieldValues fv
JOIN CountryFields cf ON fv.FieldID = cf.FieldID
GROUP BY cf.FieldID
HAVING pct < 50
ORDER BY pct;
```

## Change 3: 18 New Dedicated Parsers

### The Problem

The generic parser splits Content on `' | '` and matches label:value patterns. This fails when:
- Labels start with digits: `0-14 years: 1.06 male(s)/female`
- Values have no label: the first entry in a list
- Sub-fields use non-standard formats: `at birth: 1.05 male(s)/female`

The issue #10 contributor's Sex ratio example showed 7 sub-values being collapsed to 1.

### The Fix

Wrote dedicated parsers for every field where the generic approach fails:

```
 Parser                    Fields Covered                Sub-values
 ────────────────────────── ──────────────────────────── ──────────
 parse_sex_ratio            Sex ratio                    7 age brackets

 parse_telephones           Telephones (x2)              2 per field

## Change 4: 1996 Data Repair

During the full database rebuild, we discovered that the Project Gutenberg source for 1996 is truncated for 7 countries: Venezuela, Armenia, Greece, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, and Tuvalu. The text files end mid-sentence.

The v3.0 database had silently leaked neighboring country data into the truncated entries (e.g., Vanuatu's Communications and Defense fields appeared under Venezuela).

### The Fix

The CIA's original `wfb-96.txt.gz` file was found on the Wayback Machine:
`https://web.archive.org/web/19970528151800id_/http://www.odci.gov:80/cia/publications/nsolo/wfb-96.txt.gz`

A repair script (`etl/repair_1996_truncated.py`) parses the CIA's page-header format and replaces the truncated entries with complete data. Venezuela went from 8 fields (truncated) to 89 fields (complete).

## Acknowledgments

This release was directly driven by feedback from [@jarofromel](https://github.com/jarofromel) in [Issue #10](https://github.com/MilkMp/CIA-World-Factbooks-Archive-1990-2025/issues/10). Their suggestion to add source provenance (SourceFragment) and fix the delimiter problem (space -> pipe) led to a full pipeline rebuild that improved every metric in the database.
