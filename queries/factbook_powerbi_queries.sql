-- CIA World Factbook Archive — Sample Power BI / Analysis Queries
-- ============================================================================
-- Created: 2026-02-15
-- Database: CIA_WorldFactbook
--
-- These queries demonstrate how to use the FieldNameMappings table to pull
-- consistent time-series data across 36 years (1990-2025) despite field name
-- changes. Import these into Power BI via DirectQuery or Import mode.
--
-- Tables used:
--   MasterCountries    — Canonical country list with EntityType
--   Countries          — Year-specific country entries
--   CountryCategories  — Category groupings per country-year
--   CountryFields      — Individual data fields (the raw data)
--   FieldNameMappings  — Maps 1,132 field name variants → canonical names
-- ============================================================================


-- ============================================================================
-- 1. POPULATION TIME SERIES (single country)
-- ============================================================================
-- Pulls population estimates for a country across all available years.
-- Works despite field name changes (Population → Population, same in this case).

-- unifies them automatically.
