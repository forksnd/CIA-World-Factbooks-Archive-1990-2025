CIA Factbook Archive - Field Name Mapper
========================================
Maps the 1,132 distinct FieldName variants in CountryFields to canonical
(modern / standardized) names.  Creates a FieldNameMappings lookup table
so the original data stays untouched.

Phase 1 (default): READ-ONLY — prints proposed mappings for review.
Phase 2 (--apply):  Creates FieldNameMappings table and inserts rows.

Run:  py build_field_mappings.py          # review mode
      py build_field_mappings.py --apply  # write to database
